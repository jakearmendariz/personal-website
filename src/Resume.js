            </h3>
            <b>Distributed Key Value Store and Load Balancer</b>
                Designed and engineered a causally consistent, always available, and partition tolerant system.
                Consistent hashing distributes the requests to multiple shards. Within shards, gossip will spread requests.
                Hashing and load balancing written in Rust, data consistency code written in Python.
            <br />
            <b>Deduplicating Fork of Berkeley FFS (spring 2021)</b>
            Engineered a fork of the Berkeley Fast File System to handle logical block deduplication.
            All reads and writes are hashed and deduped, increasing storage capacity with added minimal latency.

            <b> Multiplayer Online Game from Scratch (summer 2020)</b>
            Implemented game mechanics including player health, object collision, attacks, and movement coordination which is synchronized via an rust Actix web socket server.

    <b>HTTP server and load balancer (spring 2020)</b>
    Designed and implemented a multi-threaded HTTP server and load balancer in C capable of distributing concurrent requests safely and efficiently.
